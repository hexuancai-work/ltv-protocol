1. Purpose

This repository defines the public interface specification of the LTV Protocol, 
including but not limited to routing schemas, lifetime value attribution models, 
identity weighting primitives, and associated OpenAPI interface definitions.

The specification is intended to function as a neutral documentation and registry 
surface for interoperable autonomous commerce systems.

2. Permitted Use

Subject to the terms below, the specification may be:

• Referenced in academic, technical, or commercial documentation  
• Implemented in independent software systems  
• Extended for internal or experimental use

No royalties are required for compliant technical implementations.

3. Restrictions

The following actions require explicit written authorization from LTVLABS:
