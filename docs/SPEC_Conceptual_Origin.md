## Positioning

The LTV Protocol draft specification should be viewed as an exploratory interface model aligned with the conceptual architecture described in the research article above.

It focuses on:

- Predictive value signal interfaces  
- Routing weight abstraction  
- Priority tier modeling  
- Governance and transparency surfaces  

## Scope Disclaimer

This repository does not claim to represent an industry standard. It serves as a public draft exploration of interoperable value intelligence infrastructure.
