# Research Context

## Conceptual Framing

The conceptual architecture surrounding interoperable value intelligence layers in agent commerce has been explored in the following research article:

**The Missing Value Layer in Agent Commerce — Toward a Value Intelligence Stack**

The article examines the structural role of value prediction, incentive weighting, and economic identity signals within emerging autonomous transaction systems.

It frames the separation between execution infrastructure and valuation infrastructure as a foundational design consideration for machine-driven commerce.
